                <h2>About me</h2>
                
                <p>I always held deep interest in technology, and as a child I used to design websites and experimented with various types of software.
                    I have not considered it as a career, however, the passion for solving problems with the use of IT was brought back to life during my university studies.
                    Throughout one of the modules studied, I used python programming language to conduct sentiment analysis of Twitter messages and it sparked my interest 
                    back into the IT sector. Although, I was a business student, I knew that technical knowledge interests me more than purely a commercial one. 
                    Thatâ€™s why I am highly motivated to start new career in web development. </p>
